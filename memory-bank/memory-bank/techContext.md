## Technology Context (techContext.md)

This document outlines the technology stack, development tools, environment, testing strategy, deployment process, and continuous integration approach used for the Ahmet Karabacak personal website and portfolio project.

### Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Will be used for creating a dynamic and interactive user experience.
    *   **JavaScript (ES6+):** The primary scripting language for frontend logic and interactions.
    *   **HTML5:** Standard markup language for structuring the website content.
    *   **CSS3:** Styling language for visually presenting the website, including responsive design.
    *   **[Optional] Tailwind CSS or Material UI:** A CSS framework/component library to accelerate development and maintain a consistent design language. (Choice will be determined based on design requirements and development speed preferences.)
*   **Backend (if applicable):**
    *   **[Optional] Node.js with Express.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment and web application framework for creating server-side logic if dynamic content or APIs are required. (This will only be used if a contact form with backend processing is needed, or if Ahmet wants a blog/CMS.)
    *   **[Optional] Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Netlify Functions):** An alternative to Node.js/Express for handling simple backend tasks like contact form submissions, offering scalability and cost-effectiveness. (This is the preferred option if a full backend isn't required.)
*   **Database (if applicable):**
    *   **[Optional] NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas):** A flexible database solution for storing dynamic content if a backend and CMS are implemented.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   **Git:** Distributed version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.
*   **Hosting:**
    *   **Netlify or Vercel:** Platforms for deploying and hosting static websites and serverless functions. These platforms offer easy deployment, CDN, and SSL certificates.

### Software Development Tools

*   **IDE:**
    *   **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A free and powerful source code editor with extensions for React, JavaScript, and other technologies.
*   **Package Manager:**
    *   **npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn:** For managing project dependencies and installing required libraries.
*   **Build Tool:**
    *   **Webpack or Parcel:** For bundling JavaScript, CSS, and other assets for production deployment. (If using Create React App, this is managed automatically.)
*   **Debugging Tools:**
    *   **Chrome Developer Tools or Firefox Developer Tools:** For debugging JavaScript code and inspecting the website's performance.
*   **Design Tool:**
    *   **Figma or Adobe XD:** Used for designing the website's layout and user interface.

### Development Environment

The development environment will consist of the following:

*   **Operating System:** macOS, Windows, or Linux (Developer's choice).
*   **Node.js (if applicable):** Required for running JavaScript-based development tools and backend services.
*   **Web Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, or Safari for testing and debugging the website.
*   **Git:** For version control and collaboration.
*   **Text Editor/IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or equivalent.

Each developer will have a local development environment set up to mirror the production environment as closely as possible. This will ensure consistency and minimize potential issues during deployment.

### Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will focus on ensuring the website's functionality, usability, and performance.

*   **Unit Testing (if applicable):** Testing individual components and functions to ensure they work as expected. (Jest or Mocha with Chai will be used if this is implemented.)
*   **Integration Testing (if applicable):** Testing the interaction between different components and services.
*   **End-to-End Testing:** Testing the entire website to ensure it functions correctly from the user's perspective. (Cypress or Playwright could be used for this if the project grows sufficiently complex)
*   **Responsive Testing:** Testing the website on different screen sizes and devices to ensure it is responsive and accessible.
*   **Cross-Browser Testing:** Testing the website on different web browsers to ensure compatibility.
*   **Manual Testing:** Manual testing will be performed to verify the website's usability and identify any potential issues.

### Deployment Process

The deployment process will involve the following steps:

1.  **Build:** Build the production-ready version of the website using Webpack, Parcel, or the Create React App build script.
2.  **Deploy:** Deploy the built files to Netlify or Vercel using their CLI tools or through Git integration.
3.  **Verification:** Verify that the website is deployed correctly and functioning as expected.
4.  **Monitoring:** Monitor the website's performance and identify any potential issues.

The deployment process will be automated as much as possible to ensure quick and reliable deployments.

### Continuous Integration Approach

We will use a Continuous Integration (CI) approach to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

*   **Git Repository:** All code will be stored in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
*   **CI/CD Platform:** Netlify or Vercel provide built-in CI/CD capabilities that will be used to automatically build and deploy the website whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository.
*   **Automated Testing:** Automated tests will be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure the code is working correctly.
*   **Notifications:** Notifications will be sent to the development team when builds fail or deployments are successful.

This CI approach will help us identify and fix issues early in the development process, ensuring that the website is always in a deployable state.
